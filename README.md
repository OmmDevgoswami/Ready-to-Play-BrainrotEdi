## Inspiration
After a lot of brainstorming, we wanted a tool that could help solve a real life problem while making it brain rot process engaging and enjoyable. We finally came up with a venue finder where you can book venues for sporting events, gaming competitions, or get togethers in general.

## What it does
It is a venue finder application, used find appropriate and fun location hidden in our cities. Let it be a Holiday or a boring Weekend or a handout with friends or our dear partner, Read-to-Play, got you back. Recommending the best sports, e-sports, paintball, go-karting and other fun activities !! 
Make fun memory and discover some hidden gems with our venue finder application.
But wait, there's more, say bye to the old Captcha system, we have some fun and basic games or maybe some math problems that you will need to solve before confirming you ticket, you booking rests on your skills of winning.

## How we built it
---
- Frontend: [React,Vite,Vanilla-HTML,Vanilla-CSS,Javascrpit]
- Backend: [Python-Flask]
- APIs: [Google Maps API]

## Challenges we ran into
Setting up the API was especially challenging when figuring out how to handle the location coordinates.
Since we needed to display different cities and countries. Time management was another issue since we our group consists of people living all over the world, planning a perfect meeting time with the different timezones was bit of a challenge. As well as Thanksgiving during the whole process it definitely delayed some of the progress.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Overall the project was all of our first time using React js, making us extremely proud due to how the project turned out for our first time using react. The interactive features and beautiful UI was something I was especially proud of.

## What we learned
This was our first time using react and learned a lot about the different libraries. Using react made it a lot easier than using traditional javascript especially when building a webpage. For me I was my first hackathon and working with other people that I have never met before.
## What's next for Ready to Play (Venue Booking Finder)
Eventually we would like to let users add their own venues that other people can book. then adding authentication features that can ensure that the person booking and person renting out the venue will have a safe enjoyable process.
